            <h1>Our story</h1>
            <p>The International Academy of Robotics arose from a clear need co-founded by the International Academy of Robotics,
                video in their children and the gaps he saw in their education that prevent them from realizing their full potential. Wanting to use the momentum
                children and guided by the limited educational opportunities available, founded the International Academy of Robotics with a focus on practical
                learning robotics to help students change their way of thinking and understand that they can change. Creators and innovators, and yes, if they choose to,
                no problem is too big to be solved. Technology has been a tool of choice to change the way these children think and look at the world, because it is
                that which is most interesting to them; it is their language and lies at the core of many of their interests. He designed it
                International Academy of Robotics to provide family security and foster confidence in creating a healthy learning environment.</p>

        <h3>What we do? And why?</h3>
        <p>At the International Academy of Robotics, we firmly believe that educational institutes must change to reflect the world in which our children grow up,
            with all its complexities and challenges. To create this change, we need a new educational paradigm. International Teaching Model
            Academy of Robotics is a unique space for students and the freedom to experiment creatively,
            while developing, not teachers - working with students to guide them as they discover the dimension of technology
            which is new to them. Students work as a team to explore major issues (through a focus on Objectives
            sustainable development UN) and learned how to plan and achieve their goals. Our goal is to build a culture of teamwork among students. Our curriculum
            and the program first works to build students' skills in robotics. After developing a solid foundation, students then use their newly acquired skills and knowledge to
            explore the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
            <br> 
            <br>
            Today, schools do not deal with the unique personalities and creativity of each child. Many in the end cannot fit in and benefit from the present
            educational system. Knowledge in schools today is still provided from top to bottom, with minimal student input. This does not allow students to grow up
            as critical thinkers who ask questions and know how to work with others in different settings. We believe that the appetite for learning should start
            education system. Schools should be like gardens filled with knowledge where children can develop their unique personalities and talents. To do that,
            we believe that schools should prioritize understanding and experience over memory and work to eliminate harassment and toxic competition environments
            which is the result of school rankings.</p>
